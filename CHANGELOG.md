All notable changes to DevClaw are documented in this file.

## [v1.24.0] — 2026-09-04 — Model registry, panic isolation, WhatsApp audio

### Fixed

- **A panic in any tool took the whole daemon down.** `recover()` guarded the
  scheduler, hooks, dream and the WhatsApp channel, but not the path that
  actually runs tools: `tool_executor.go`, `agent.go` and `assistant.go` had
  none. A nil dereference in any registered tool — or in a plugin's native
  handler — unwound past the executor and killed the process, dropping every
  channel and every in-flight run with it. `executeSingle` now turns a panic
  into a failed tool call, which also covers the concurrent group since its
  goroutines call through it.
- **The web chat hung forever when a stream ended without a terminal event.**
  The handler returned as soon as the event channel closed, so the HTTP body
  just stopped; the client clears its streaming state only on `done`/`error`,
  leaving a permanent spinner with Send stuck as Stop. The server now always
  emits a final frame, and the client synthesises one if a stream ends without
  it — a dropped connection produced the same hang.
- **The answer to a resumed run could vanish silently.** `assistant.go` was the
  one place sending a final response without checking the error, and it runs
  about two seconds after boot, while channels are still reconnecting. The
  history entry immediately after marks the message as delivered and the
  interrupted-run record has already been cleared, so a failed send lost the
  answer for good, with nothing in the log.
- **The model's reasoning was delivered to users as chat messages.** On the
  Anthropic Messages API path, `thinking_delta` events were forwarded straight
  to the stream callback — deliberately, to keep a UI busy during reasoning. But
  that callback is what channels turn into messages, so on WhatsApp every
  thought arrived as its own message, in whatever language the model reasons in.
  Nothing downstream could stop it: the block streamer filters *tagged* blocks
  and a `thinking_delta` carries no tags, while the channel-side check only
  matches text starting with `Reasoning:` or a thinking tag. The leak became
  constant with models that cannot switch reasoning off (GLM-5.3). Reasoning is
  now wrapped in `<thinking>` before it reaches the callback, matching what the
  OpenAI-compatible path already did with `reasoning_content`, so the existing
  filters remove it for channels and the web UI can still render it. The wrapper
  is closed when real text starts and again at end of stream, so a truncated
  stream cannot leave an unterminated block that escapes the filter.
- **Audio from WhatsApp was never transcribed.** A key stored in the encrypted
  vault, the way this project requires, could not reach transcription: the vault
  exports every entry as an environment variable, but nothing carried one onto
  `media.transcription_api_key`, and the vault-to-config step only maps the key
  belonging to the *current* provider. Transcription therefore fell back to the
  main API key and, on a config carrying a leftover `transcription_base_url`,
  sent it to a different vendor's endpoint. `ResolveSecrets` now resolves that
  field like it already did for channel tokens, and `ResolveForProvider` no
  longer derives an endpoint when a dedicated key is set — pointing one
  vendor's key at another vendor's host is never right.

### Changed

- **The test suite and CI now cover the WebUI, gateway and WhatsApp packages.**
  `make test` and the CI job each ran a hand-written package list, the two lists
  had drifted apart, and both left out `pkg/devclaw/webui`, `pkg/devclaw/gateway`
  and `pkg/devclaw/channels/whatsapp` — the last of which already had four test
  files that never ran anywhere. All three pass today, so this is pure coverage:
  the security tests added above would otherwise never have run in CI.

### Security

- **CORS reflected any Origin back with credentials**, on every build, across
  the whole mux. Any site the user visited could call the API with their cookie.
  Loopback stays allowed so the dev server keeps working; anything else must be
  listed in `webui.cors_origins`.
- **`?token=` was accepted on every route**, not just the SSE streams that need
  it, leaking the token into access logs and `Referer` headers. It is now
  honoured only for `text/event-stream` requests, which is the one case where
  the browser cannot send a header instead.

### Fixed (model registry)

- **A model name with a gateway prefix matched nothing.** `getModelDefaults` and
  `getModelContextWindowByName` matched the raw name with `HasPrefix`/`Contains`,
  and nothing normalised it first. A config of `gatorllm/gpt-5.4` — or any
  OpenRouter-style `anthropic/claude-...` — missed every case and fell through to
  the OpenAI-compatible default, sending `temperature: 0.7` and `max_tokens` to a
  reasoning model that accepts neither. Names now resolve through the registry:
  exact match, then the segment after the last `/`, then longest prefix. The
  suffix step runs after the exact match, so Ollama tags (`llama3:8b`) and
  HuggingFace repos (`org/repo`) are unaffected.
- **Anthropic requests failed outright on Claude 4.7 and later.** Every `claude-*`
  entry declared `DefaultTemperature: 1.0`, and both Anthropic call sites sent it
  whenever it was set. Sampling parameters were removed from Claude 4.7 on and
  return a 400, so `claude-opus-5` failed on every request. Those models now omit
  the field; 4.6, Haiku 4.5 and older keep sending it. (`anthropicSamplingFor`
  replaces the block that was duplicated across the streaming and non-streaming
  paths.)
- **A folded key could swallow a longer number.** `gpt-4.1` folds to the key
  `gpt-4-1`, which is a genuine prefix of the real id `gpt-4-1106-preview`. That
  model would have started receiving `max_completion_tokens` and no temperature —
  parameters it rejects. Prefix matching now requires a segment boundary: a key
  ending in a digit never matches a longer digit run.
- **A model without a published price reported zero cost.** Because resolution
  returns the longest match, the new `gpt-5.6` and the existing `glm-5.1` — both
  without their own price — shadowed the priced family prefix and silently billed
  $0. Pricing now walks on to the nearest priced ancestor.
- **The 1M beta header and the reported window could disagree.**
  `isAnthropic1MModel` still matched raw names with `HasPrefix`, so it never fired
  for gateway-prefixed ids and had no idea what the registry reported. It now
  reads `BetaContextWindow` from the same table.
- **Fast mode was a silent no-op on models with no `low` effort.** It asked for
  `low` unconditionally; on GPT-6 Astra, whose lowest level is `medium`, the field
  was dropped while `service_tier: priority` stayed set — premium pricing, no
  latency gain. It now picks the cheapest level the model actually offers, and
  omits the parameter entirely on models that do not accept it at all.
- **Cost estimates were order-dependent.** The prefix fallback in `estimateCost`
  iterated a map, so `gpt-5-mini` could be billed at `gpt-5` rates depending on
  iteration order. Resolution is now a deterministic longest-prefix match.

### Added

- **GPT-6 Astra** (`gpt-6-astra`) — 1,050,000 token context, reasoning effort
  `medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`.
- **GPT-5.6 family** (`gpt-5.6` and the `-sol`/`-terra`/`-luna` variants) —
  1,050,000 token context, effort `none` through `max`.
- **Claude 5 family** — `claude-opus-5`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-fable-5`,
  `claude-fable-5-1` at a 1M context window, plus `claude-opus-4-7`,
  `claude-opus-4-8` and `claude-haiku-4-5`.
- **GLM 5.2, 5.3 and 5.3-flash** — 1M context. GLM-5.3 runs with reasoning
  always on and accepts `low`/`high`/`max` effort, which the registry now
  declares so an unsupported level is never sent.
- `params.reasoning_effort` is configurable and takes precedence over the
  fast-mode default. A level the model does not accept is dropped with a warning
  instead of being sent.

### Changed

- **Per-model behaviour now lives in one table** (`copilot/models.go`). Context
  window, output cap, sampling support, tokenizer ratio and pricing were spread
  across four functions with three different naming conventions (`claude-opus-4-6`
  in one, `claude-opus-4.6` in another), which is how the drift accumulated.
  `getModelDefaults`, `getModelContextWindowByName`, `charsPerToken` and the usage
  tracker are now thin wrappers over `LookupModel`, each keeping a family
  heuristic for custom and fine-tuned names the table cannot know about.
- `claude-haiku-4-5` reports its real 200k context window instead of falling
  through to the 128k default.

### Notes

- The 1M window is applied only to the Claude 5 family, where it is ungated. On
  the 4.x family it stays at 200k because this codebase reaches 1M there through
  the opt-in `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header (`isAnthropic1MModel`), and
  under-reporting the window only costs an early compaction while over-reporting
  would fail the request.
- `MaxOutput` stays at the values DevClaw already requested rather than each
  model's 128k ceiling: that ceiling needs the streaming path to avoid HTTP
  timeouts. Raising it is a follow-up.
- Anthropic fast mode (`speed: "fast"` + the `fast-mode-2026-02-01` beta) is
  deliberately not included — it carries premium pricing and is tracked separately.

## [v1.23.2] — 2026-06-22 — Scheduled routines run as real tasks

### Fixed

- **Scheduled task-routines could never complete.** Every scheduled job ran
  through a 1-turn, "do NOT use any tools" delivery path (the SQLite job store
  has no `as_subagent` column, so no job could opt into the richer path). Routines
  that need real work — financial summary (skill + DB), daily English-study PDF
  (skill + DB + PDF + send), flight-price search (web_search) — hit the turn
  budget at turn 2 and force-summarized before doing anything, emitting half-baked
  output. Scheduled jobs now run as autonomous owner tasks: full prompt (skills +
  memory), tools enabled, a 15-turn budget. Simple reminders still deliver in one
  turn. (`assistant.go`)
- **Reasoning leaked to users.** Output sanitization matched only the long
  `<thinking>`/`<reasoning>` tags and kept their content; the short `<think>` form
  (emitted by GLM) slipped through entirely. `StripInternalTags` and the block
  streamer now remove the whole `<think|thinking|reasoning>` block — content
  included — plus a trailing unclosed reasoning block. (`markdown.go`,
  `block_streamer.go`)
- **Leaked foreign control tokens.** A trailing CJK continuation phrase that GLM
  occasionally appends to an otherwise Portuguese/English answer is now stripped;
  genuine CJK messages (majority CJK) are left untouched. (`markdown.go`)

## [v1.23.1] — 2026-06-22 — Atomic chunking of rich memories

### Changed

- **Rich multi-fact memories are now split into atomic facts.** A full flight
  itinerary saved as one long chunk diluted its embedding, so a narrow query
  ("qual o localizador da minha passagem?") lost to shorter focused chunks and
  the specific fact never surfaced. Content is now split on sentence/line
  boundaries (never commas, so flight legs stay intact) and each fact is stored
  as its own curated memory — e.g. "Localizador ida: WGADGP" becomes a discrete,
  directly-retrievable chunk.
  - `atomic_chunk.go`: `splitAtomicFacts` splitter (partitions, no text loss).
  - `SaveCuratedMemory`: stores each atomic fact separately.
  - **Self-healing re-chunk on boot** (`rechunk.go`): already-stored long curated
    memories are split into atomic facts, metadata + `occurred_at` + wing copied,
    the original soft-deleted. Marker-gated, idempotent, fail-open.

### Notes

- Verified on production data: re-chunk split 199 long memories; the flight
  locator now surfaces as its own chunk for "qual o localizador" (was buried in
  the blob), with no regression on trip/shopping-list recall.

## [v1.23.0] — 2026-06-22 — Multilingual embeddings

### Changed

- **Local embedding model swapped to multilingual** — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (English)
  → `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`. The English model couldn't match
  Portuguese paraphrases (e.g. "bilhetes"/"vôos" against stored "voo"/"localizador"),
  so PT-BR recall was poor: relevant memories scored below threshold or didn't rank.
  The multilingual model fixes semantic recall for PT-BR. Same BERT interface
  (3 inputs, 384-dim, mean-pooled `last_hidden_state`) so the ONNX session, pooling
  and vector storage are unchanged — only the tokenizer differs.
  - New pure-Go SentencePiece **Unigram tokenizer** (`tokenizer_unigram.go`) loaded
    from `tokenizer.json` (Viterbi + Metaspace + NFKC), with exact token-id parity
    against the reference `tokenizers` library.
  - **Self-healing re-embed on boot** (`reembed.go`): when the active model differs
    from the recorded marker, the whole corpus is re-embedded in the new vector
    space and the marker updated. Marker-gated (no-op once recorded), idempotent,
    fail-open — no manual steps, no DB surgery.

### Notes

- First restart after upgrade re-embeds the corpus (~minutes for a few thousand
  chunks); during that window vector recall is briefly degraded while BM25 keeps
  working. One-time.
- Known follow-up: rich multi-fact saves (e.g. a full flight itinerary) are stored
  as one long chunk, which dilutes retrieval for narrow queries ("qual o
  localizador"). Atomic chunking of such saves is the next recall improvement.

## [v1.22.3] — 2026-06-21 — Temporal recall regression fix

### Fixed

- **Date-scoped questions returned nothing when the relevant memory was undated.**
  v1.22.2's occurred_at window was a HARD filter (`occurred_at >= ? AND < ?`), and
  in SQL a NULL fails that comparison — so any query carrying a temporal cue
  ("informações da minha viagem do dia 23", "o que rolou na sexta") excluded every
  chunk with `occurred_at IS NULL`. Since most of the corpus (and freshly-saved
  facts) are undated, recall collapsed to zero for those queries. The window now
  lets NULL pass — undated chunks compete on relevance and only DATED chunks on
  other days are pruned. (`sqlite_store.go`: `occurredFilter.sqlFragment`/`matches`)

### Changed

- **Temporal questions prefer `memory_search` over ad-hoc bash on the conversation
  DB.** The `memory_search` tool description and the memory skill guide now instruct
  the agent to pass the natural-language date-scoped question as the query (the date
  window is applied automatically) instead of hand-writing SQL against `lcm_messages`.
  (`memory_tools.go`, `builtin/skills/memory/SKILL.md`)

## [v1.22.2] — 2026-06-21 — Temporal recall (self-heal)

### Fixed

- **The agent couldn't answer "what happened on Thursday/Friday".** The v2 import
  discarded each memory's original timestamp — every imported chunk was stamped
  with the migration date — so date-scoped questions ("o que rolou na sexta",
  "semana passada", "dia 18") could not retrieve the right memories, and temporal
  decay was meaningless (all memories looked the same age). Fixed, **self-healing
  on the next restart** (no manual steps, no DB edits; original dates are still in
  the untouched .md files):
  - **occurred_at column** preserves each memory's real original timestamp on
    import (parsed in local time so it's a true instant). (`migration_memory_v2.go` schema v3, `migration_import.go`)
  - **Boot-time backfill** re-reads the .md files and restamps occurred_at on
    already-imported memories, matching by content hash. Version-gated (user_version=4),
    idempotent, fail-open. (`migration_backfill_occurred.go`)
  - **Date-aware recall**: a query carrying a temporal cue (PT-BR + EN: hoje/ontem,
    weekday names, "semana passada", "dia N", dates) is resolved to a day-granular
    local-time window and recall is filtered by occurred_at within it; pure-content
    queries are unaffected. (`temporal_query.go`, `sqlite_store.go`, `memory_tools.go`)
  - **Temporal decay now uses occurred_at** (fallback created_at), so memory age
    reflects the real date again.

## [v1.22.1] — 2026-06-21 — Memory recall recalibration (self-heal)

### Fixed

- **Recall stopped surfacing most real memories after the v2 migration.** The
  curation quality scorer (ported from anchored) was miscalibrated for a personal
  assistant: ordinary facts with no project/scope scored below the low-signal
  threshold, so on a real store **94% of memories (2936/3120) were demoted to
  `low_signal` and recall HARD-EXCLUDED them** — recent conversations (trips,
  client proposals, receipts) became invisible. Three coordinated fixes, all
  **self-healing on the next restart** (no manual steps, no DB edits):
  - **Scorer recalibrated (v4):** `fact` now carries positive weight, the
    "unscoped" penalty is removed, length/word penalties only hit near-empty
    fragments. Genuine noise (test output, progress narration, error dumps) still
    demotes. (`quality.go`)
  - **Boot-time re-curation:** a version-gated, idempotent, fail-open pass re-scores
    every chunk whose `scorer_version` is stale and clears the wrongful `low_signal`
    flags on startup. (`migration_recurate.go`, wired in `initSchema`)
  - **Soft-demote instead of hard-exclude:** recall now ranks `low_signal` lower
    (×0.15) rather than removing it, so nothing is ever fully hidden again.
    (`chunkLifecycleGuard` + ranking)
  - Validated on a copy of the production store: recallable **184 → 2986**,
    low_signal **2936 → 134**, credential leaks still **0**, and previously-hidden
    topics recall again.

## [v1.22.0] — 2026-06-21 — Memory v2

### Added

- **Memory v2: SQLite becomes the single source of truth.** On startup, a
  one-time, idempotent, fail-open migration imports and **curates** the legacy
  flat-markdown memory (`MEMORY.md` + daily `20*.md`) into the vectorized SQLite
  store, then the system stops reading/indexing those `.md` files. The `.md`
  files are never deleted or edited — they remain on disk as a natural backup.
  Existing users self-heal on first boot after `git pull && make build && restart`.
  - Schema v2 lifecycle columns on `chunks` (`deleted_at`, `expires_at`,
    `supersedes`, `curation_status`, `importance`, `confidence`, `memory_type`,
    `kind`, `scope`, …), version-gated via `PRAGMA user_version`
    (`migration_memory_v2.go`).
  - Import + curation: drops `[Contradiction]` bloat, exact-hash dedup,
    quality-scoring (low-signal demotion < 0.55), category classification +
    TTLs, **credential redaction before storage**, re-embedding via the local
    ONNX provider, then space reclaim (`migration_import.go`, `quality.go`,
    `credential_redact.go`). Idempotent via a sentinel marker row; runs async
    off the startup path so re-embedding never blocks the agent.

### Fixed

- **Recall no longer surfaces deleted/expired/garbage memories.** All recall
  paths (BM25, vector cache, LIKE fallback, hybrid) now exclude
  `deleted_at`/expired/`low_signal` chunks (`chunkLifecycleGuard`), and the
  in-memory vector cache is evicted on lifecycle mutations
  (`EvictFromVectorCache`).
- **A trivial greeting no longer injects long-term memory.** Injection
  `min_score` raised `0.1 → 0.35`; `shouldSkipMemoryRecall` skips recall for
  greetings/extremely-short inputs (questions with `?` still search).
- **Dream now actually resolves contradictions** by superseding the losing
  memory (`deleted_at` + `supersedes` + cache eviction) instead of re-appending
  `[Contradiction]` summaries that grew `MEMORY.md` unbounded.
- Category-scaled temporal decay + MMR enabled by default; legacy null-wing
  results are demoted (not neutral) in wing-aware queries.

### Known limitations

- Dream contradiction **detection** still reads from the FileStore; post-cutover
  contradiction *resolution* operates on SQLite by content match (detection of
  brand-new SQLite-only contradictions is a follow-up).
- End-to-end migration test and the final independent architect/deslop review
  pass are pending (org spend limit reached mid-run).

## [v1.21.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Runtime self-management of external MCP servers (`mcp` tool).** The main
  agent can now configure, start, stop, manage and authenticate external MCP
  (Model Context Protocol) servers without editing config or restarting. Actions:
  `list`, `add`, `remove`, `enable`, `disable`, `start`, `stop`, `test`,
  `authorize`. Connected servers expose their tools as `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.
  Owner/admin only; changes are persisted to `config.yaml` (secrets sanitized to
  `${ENV}`) and applied live.
- **MCP transports.** Local processes via **stdio** and remote servers via
  **Streamable HTTP / SSE** (session-id reuse, SSE response parsing).
- **MCP OAuth 2.1.** Automatic endpoint discovery (RFC 8414 / RFC 9728) and
  Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) with PKCE. The agent returns a consent
  URL through its channel; the provider redirects to the local callback
  (`/oauth/mcp/callback`); tokens are stored in the encrypted vault per server
  with transparent refresh. No manual client registration required.

### Changed

- WebUI MCP Start/Stop now connect/disconnect servers live (previously no-ops).
- **Dependencies:** updated `whatsmeow` (~4 months of upstream connection/keepalive
  fixes), `go.mau.fi/util` v0.9.10, `go.mau.fi/libsignal` v0.2.2. Build now
  requires Go 1.25.

### Fixed

- MCP stdio notifications were sent with `"id":0`, which strict servers answer
  as requests and desync the stream (0 tools discovered). Notifications now omit
  the id per JSON-RPC 2.0.

## [v1.20.0] — 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Agent self-configuration (`settings` tool).** The main agent can now read and
  change a whitelisted set of its own runtime settings and have them apply
  immediately (hot-reload, no restart). Supported keys: `media.vision_enabled`,
  `media.vision_model` (empty = use the main model), `media.vision_detail`,
  `media.transcription_enabled`, `media.transcription_model`,
  `media.transcription_base_url`, `media.transcription_language`, and `model`.
  Changes are validated, persisted to `config.yaml` via the sanitized save path
  (secrets become `${ENV}` refs, never written in plaintext), then applied live
  via `UpdateMediaConfig` / `UpdateLLMClient`. Owner/admin only; the whitelist is
  a hard security boundary — security, access, vault, channels, and API keys are
  NOT settable through the tool.



### Fixed

- **Small attachments rejected with "mensagem excede o tamanho máximo permitido".**
  The input guardrail validated the *enriched* message (which includes extracted
  document text / transcriptions) against `security.max_input_length`, whose
  default was only 4096 chars — so a document of a few KB tripped it. Raised the
  default (and the guardrail fallback) to 200000, matching the downstream input
  bound. Media payloads remain separately capped by `media.max_image_size` /
  `max_audio_size`. Existing configs should bump `security.max_input_length`.

## [v1.19.2] — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Removed the Workflows menu entry** — the Workflows page renders mock data and
  has no backend yet, so it is not exposed in the UI. The Plugins nav entry and
  `/plugins` route are restored; `/workflows` now redirects to `/plugins`. The
  `Workflows.tsx` page is kept in the tree for when the backend lands.

## [v1.19.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp replies misdelivered (regression from v1.19.0).** The JID fix in
  v1.19.0 routed the outgoing recipient through `normalizeJID`, which applies
  `normalizeBRPhone` and inserts the mobile 9th digit into genuine 12-digit
  Brazilian numbers (e.g. `558287015132` → `5582987015132`). Replies were then
  sent to a non-existent number — WhatsApp accepted the send with no error, so
  the agent processed messages but the user never received responses. The send
  path now strips only the channel prefix and companion device part
  (`stripDevicePart`), never mutating the phone digits. Lookups are unaffected.

## [v1.19.0] — 2026-06-15

Memory/context reliability + web UI redesign. Diagnosed from production logs
where the agent kept recalling stale/contradictory facts after compaction and
failed on two execution bugs; also reskins the web UI and adds a Workflows
surface. Builds on the v1.19.0-rc1 layered memory stack.

### Added

- **Web UI — "Parchment + Sienna" visual direction.** Reskinned at the Tailwind
  token layer: warm parchment paper (ink #1a1714), burnt-sienna accent
  (#b85a26), Geist / Geist Mono typography, and a three-slash claw-mark logo.
  Dark mode tokens unchanged.
- **Workflows page.** New UI to chain agents into multi-step automations (status
  badges, search, create panel with per-step agent selection), replacing the
  Plugins nav entry (`/plugins` redirects to `/workflows`). Renders mock data —
  a functional UI preview ahead of backend persistence/execution. Translated in
  en/es/pt.

- **Memory lifecycle metadata v2** — `memory.Entry` gains optional, backward-
  compatible fields (`Supersedes`, `Consolidates`, `Importance`, `Pinned`,
  `Origin`, `MemoryType`, `ContextTier`, `Superseded`), persisted in a compact
  `[meta:<base64-json>]` tag emitted only when set. Legacy `MEMORY.md` entries
  parse and serialize unchanged. Helpers: `IsExpired`, `IsPinned`,
  `IsSuperseded`, `ContentKey`.
- **Pre-compaction working-context snapshot** — before compaction the assistant
  saves a compact operational snapshot (goal, recent tools, last action) as an
  `Origin=precompact`, `MemoryType=operational` memory with a 24h TTL, so the
  agent no longer re-derives in-flight work it already did.
- **Conservative retention sweep** — `FileStore.RetentionSweep` (dry-run by
  default) archives aged operational/episodic and expired entries to
  `MEMORY.archive.md` before removal (reversible soft-delete). Pinned and
  semantic memories are never swept.

### Changed

- **Dream now resolves contradictions instead of only reporting them** — the
  consolidation phase supersedes the older side of a contradiction via a soft
  `[stale]` marker (skipped on read, dropped by Compact) and merges duplicates,
  unifying the general and evidence-based paths. Pinned memories are never
  superseded. Removes the unbounded append-only `[Contradiction]` reports that
  accumulated in production. New telemetry: `contradictions_resolved`.
  Resolution is conservative: evidence-based contradictions (a newer positive
  fact about an entity) always resolve, while the weaker general negation
  heuristic only supersedes when the pair is a near-duplicate restatement
  (Jaccard ≥ 0.6). The `dream.disable_contradiction_resolution` escape hatch
  turns auto-resolution off entirely (detect + log only).

### Fixed

- **Scheduled-message delivery JID** — `parseJID` strips a `whatsapp:` channel
  prefix and companion device part before sending, and the scheduler strips a
  duplicated channel prefix from `chat_id` at job creation. Fixes cron
  announcements failing with "recipient must be a user JID with no device part".
- **skill_db registry self-heal** — `skill_db_query`/related now reconcile a
  table that exists physically but is missing from `_skill_tables_registry`
  (e.g. created via raw SQL), recovering its real schema and row count, instead
  of failing with "skill has no tables".
- **Memory tag-injection hardening** — `Save` escapes `[expires:]`/`[meta:]`
  prefixes in user content (previously only `SaveIfNotDuplicate` did), so a fact
  containing those literals can't be re-parsed as structural metadata.

### Hardening (subagent delivery & stability)

- **Subagent announce/delivery** — populate `OriginChannel`/`OriginTo` on spawn,
  default delivery scope to `all`, actually implement `delivery_scope=external`,
  forbid subagents from self-delivering to channels, and unblock the announce
  inject path. `spawn_subagent` hints pairing with `sessions_yield`.
- **DaemonManager lifecycle** — tied to a parent context with a tested shutdown
  cascade; context propagated through `wait_subagent` and hook dispatch.
- **SQLite busy-retry** — opt-in retry helper with jitter, wired into embedding
  cache writes, to absorb transient `database is locked` contention.
- **Bootstrap injection scan** — bootstrap files scanned for prompt-injection
  patterns (warn by default).
- **Scheduler** — suppress delivery for silent scheduled output.
- **Setup wizard** — defaults to the SQLite memory backend.

## [v1.19.0-rc1] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Layered memory stack** — new L0 (identity) / L1 (essential per-wing
  story) / L2 (on-demand entity-driven retrieval) layers compose into
  the prompt via the new `MemoryStack` type. Defaults to ON when
  `memory.hierarchy.enabled: true`. See `docs/memory-system.md` for
  details.
- `devclaw identity edit` — new CLI subcommand that opens `$EDITOR`
  on `~/.devclaw/identity.md`, creating a default template on first
  run. The file is hot-reloaded via fsnotify.
- **Wing-aware hybrid search** — queries tagged with a wing boost
  matching files (default ×1.3) and penalize mismatched non-NULL
  wings (default ×0.4). `wing IS NULL` files are always neutral
  (multiplier 1.0) to preserve Sprint 1 retrocompat.
- **Automatic wing routing on save** — `memory_save` now assigns
  `files.wing` from either an explicit LLM argument or the session's
  channel/chatID via `ContextRouter`, with zero cost for unrouted
  CLI/MCP sessions.
- **Legacy classifier in the dream cycle** — background dream
  consolidation runs a bounded pattern-based classifier over
  `wing IS NULL` files when the user has configured
  `memory.hierarchy.legacy_keywords`. No LLM calls. User must opt in
  with their own keyword map — the binary ships zero defaults.
- **New telemetry counters:** `layer_tokens_l0`, `layer_tokens_l1`,
  `layer_tokens_l2`, `l1_cache_hit_total`, `l1_cache_miss_total`,
  `classifier_pass_total`, `save_wing_routed_total`.
- `memory.stack.force_legacy` escape hatch — set to `true` in YAML
  to bypass the layered stack entirely and fall back to v1.18.0
  prompt composition.

### Fixed

- **`DreamConsolidator` no longer orphan** — the dream system shipped
  in v1.17.0 was never wired into the Assistant runtime. Sprint 2
  fixes this: dream now actually starts with the daemon. Existing
  users get background consolidation for the first time on upgrade.
- Accent stripping is unified between the router and memory packages
  via exported `memory.StripAccents` — eliminates the NFD-combining-
  mark divergence that silently broke router heuristic matching for
  macOS/iOS inputs.

### Changed

- `HybridSearch`/`HybridSearchWithOptions` are now thin wrappers over
  the new `HybridSearchWithOpts(ctx, query, opts HybridSearchOptions)`
  — external callers see byte-identical behavior; internal code gains
  wing-awareness. `QueryWing=""` remains byte-identical to v1.18.0
  (proven by `TestHybridSearchEmptyQueryWingByteIdentical`).

### Retrocompat

- Existing v1.18.0 databases upgrade without migration. New tables
  (`essential_stories`) are added via idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`. Existing rows are never rewritten. Users with
  `memory.hierarchy.enabled: false` see zero behavior change.

## [1.17.0] — 2026-03-31

### Core — Agent Intelligence

- **Streaming tool executor**: Read-only tools (grep, ls, git_log, read_file, etc.) now execute in parallel within the same turn. Serial tools (bash, write_file) form barriers between concurrent groups. Abort cascade cancels siblings on non-recoverable errors. Results always returned in original call order. 25 tools marked concurrent-safe by default
- **Multi-level proactive compaction pipeline**: 4-level context management triggered by pressure thresholds — Collapse (70%, truncate tool results), MicroCompact (80%, clear old results), AutoCompact (93%, LLM summarization), MemoryCompact (97%, extract memories + aggressive compaction). Circuit breaker prevents compaction loops (3 failures → 5min cooldown)
- **Structured memory extraction**: Pre-compaction memory extractor analyzes conversation and saves categorized memories (decisions, preferences, facts, learnings) as structured JSON before context is compressed. Memories persisted as files in memory directory and indexed for future session search
- **Dream system**: Background memory consolidation goroutine runs when daemon is idle. 3-gate trigger (6h minimum + 2 sessions + file lock). Detects duplicate memories (prefix matching) and contradictions (semantic overlap + negation). Atomic lock acquisition prevents concurrent dreams. State persists across restarts
- **Phase-based query loop**: Defines Phase interface and QueryLoop orchestrator for incremental migration from monolithic agent loop. 5 phases: Prepare → APICall → ToolExec → Decision → StopCheck. Supports LoopBack (tool_use), Stop (text response), and Inject (re-inject message) actions. StopCheckPhase integrates with completion verification (capped at 3 injections)
- **Coordinator protocol**: 4-phase multi-agent orchestration — Research (parallel read-only workers) → Synthesis (coordinator analyzes) → Implementation (write workers) → Verification (test workers). Per-phase tool restrictions prevent unintended side effects. Configurable concurrency limits per phase
- **Stop hooks**: Pre-stop completion verification analyzes recent tool output for incomplete work patterns (code edited but tests not run, build not verified). Injects reminder messages to prompt the agent to finish. Matched against tool output only to avoid false positives
- **Enhanced bash command analyzer**: Expanded risk patterns for git safety (push --force, reset --hard, clean -f), SQL safety (DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, DELETE FROM), Docker (rm, prune), and process control (kill -9). Removed find/awk/sed from safe command list (can execute arbitrary code). Added suspicious pattern detection for curl|sh, eval, --no-verify, --force

---

## [1.16.0] — 2026-03-22

### Channels — Multi-Instance & QR Lifecycle

- **Multi-instance channel creation**: `CreateChannelInstanceFn` now calls `RegisterAndConnect()` instead of `Register()` for all 4 channel types (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack), ensuring new instances are fully connected on creation
- **Instance-aware QR closures**: Moved `GetWhatsAppStatusByInstanceFn`, `SubscribeWhatsAppQRByInstanceFn`, `RequestWhatsAppQRByInstanceFn`, and `DisconnectWhatsAppByInstanceFn` outside the default-instance guard so they work for dynamically created instances
- **SSE named events for instances**: `channel_instance_handlers.go` now uses `writeSSE(w, flusher, evt.Type, evt)` with named events (`code`, `success`, `timeout`, `error`) matching the frontend's `addEventListener` expectations
- **WhatsApp QR lifecycle overhaul**: Removed auto-QR generation on `Connect()` (now sets `StateWaitingQR` and waits for explicit request); added `qrGuard atomic.Bool` to prevent concurrent QR generation; `RequestNewQR` goroutine uses instance context (`w.ctx`) instead of process context to stop on disconnect; `Disconnect()` notifies QR observers with `close` event before cancelling context
- **Instance lock safety**: All instance-aware closures in `serve.go` now acquire `instanceMu.RLock()` before reading `waInstances` map; error event emitted for unknown instance IDs instead of silent closed channel
- **Generic instance status**: `handleInstanceStatus` now handles non-WhatsApp channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) via `ListChannelInstancesFn` fallback, fixing 501 errors
- **Instance handler routing**: Added 405 Method Not Allowed response and GET guard for status endpoint

### Concurrency & Stability

- **Workspace Resolve() race fix**: Changed from single `Lock()` to double-check locking pattern — `RLock` for read path, upgrade to `Lock` only when creating new session store
- **Multiuser update_role race fix**: Single locked section for user lookup + role mutation instead of separate `GetUser()` + lock
- **Context propagation**: `RequestNewQR` and default-instance QR closures use server context (`ctx`) instead of `context.Background()`, ensuring goroutines stop on shutdown
- **NeedsQR field**: `ListChannelInstancesFn` now populates `NeedsQR` via type assertion for WhatsApp instances

### Backend Cleanup

- **Removed team system**: Deleted `team_manager.go`, `team_memory.go`, `team_tools.go`, `team_types.go`, `notification_dispatcher.go` and their tests; removed `builtin/skills/teams/SKILL.md`; removed `"Team"` category from `tool_profiles.go` and corresponding test cases
- **Tool groups sync**: Removed `"group:teams"` from `GetToolGroups()`; added `"send_media"` to media group; added `"group:browser"` and `"group:skill_db"`
- **Path resolution**: Replaced 5 hardcoded paths in `serve.go` with `paths.Resolve*()` calls (skills dir, TLS dir, hub_config.json)
- **Permissions fix**: Removed `ResolveWorkspaceTemplatesDir()` from `EnsureStateDirs` (was 0755, now only created by `EnsureWorkspaceTemplates` with 0700)
- **CLI help text**: Updated `--channel` flag to list all 4 supported channels
- **Stale comment fix**: Updated "teams" reference to "agents" in `prompt_layers.go`
- **Test adjustments**: `builtin_skills_test.go` threshold updated from `< 2` to `< 10`; removed 3 `team_*` test cases from `tool_profiles_test.go`

### Workspace Templates

- **Enriched templates**: `configs/templates/` files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md) upgraded from skeleton placeholders to substantive content matching `configs/bootstrap/` quality — includes vault guide, boundaries, continuity instructions, and security notes

### Frontend

- **WhatsApp QR on-demand**: Removed auto `requestQR()` from useEffect; QR generation only triggers on explicit user action; proper error handling on `requestQR().catch()`
- **Telegram instance-aware**: `TelegramConnect.tsx` branches on `instanceId` for status/disconnect API calls using instance endpoints; fixed `phone_number` → `phone` type mismatch
- **CSS fixes**: Fixed 5 missing-space class concatenation bugs across `WhatsAppConnect.tsx` and `TelegramConnect.tsx` (`border-secondarypy-4` → `border-secondary py-4`, etc.)
- **Toggle knob size**: Fixed non-standard `h-4.5 w-4.5` to `h-5 w-5` in `Toggle.tsx`
- **Agents page i18n**: Full internationalization of `Agents.tsx` with `agentsPage` section in `en.json` and `pt.json`

### TLS / HTTPS

- **Self-signed TLS support**: New `pkg/devclaw/tls` package generates ECDSA P-256 certificates (10yr validity, SHA-256, 0600 permissions) using Go's `crypto/x509` stdlib — no OpenSSL dependency required
- **WebUI + Gateway HTTPS**: Both servers support `tls.enabled: true` in config with conditional `ListenAndServeTLS`, enforcing TLS 1.2 minimum
- **CLI `devclaw tls`**: New `generate` and `info` subcommands for certificate management (fingerprint, expiry)
- **Auto-generation on startup**: When `auto_generate: true` (default), certificates are generated automatically on first `devclaw serve` with SHA-256 fingerprint logged
- **Install script TLS**: Three-tier fallback (devclaw binary → openssl → skip), `--no-tls` flag to skip

### Deploy / CI

- **macOS Apple Silicon fix**: Removed Darwin from GoReleaser (was using `CGO_ENABLED=0` breaking SQLite FTS5); added native `release-macos` job in GitHub Actions with `CGO_ENABLED=1` for arm64 + amd64
- **CI macOS matrix**: Tests now run on both `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`
- **Docker multi-arch**: Removed hardcoded `--platform=linux/arm64` from runtime stage in Dockerfile
- **Install script GitHub mode**: New `--github` flag downloads from GitHub Releases (GoReleaser tar.gz archives)

### Channels

- **Telegram & WhatsApp message tracking**: Added `SentMessageTracker` interface for accurate reply detection; message deduplication in WhatsApp during reconnections; Telegram message editing via `EditMessageID`; structured error types for Telegram API; latency metrics in health reporting
- **Channel token management**: Vault-based token storage for Telegram, secure environment variable injection, and configuration status in health reports
- **Discord & Slack removal**: Simplified messaging channels to WhatsApp and Telegram; removed Discord and Slack integrations from serve command, setup wizard, and UI
- **WhatsApp access control fix**: Setup wizard now mirrors global access config into `channels.whatsapp.access`; `serve.go` inherits global → channel config as fallback
- **Telegram management UI**: Complete management stack with Connection and Settings tabs, hot-reload on token changes, connect/disconnect flows, full i18n (PT/EN/ES)

### Core — Agent & Copilot

- **Subagent yield fix**: `collectPendingSubagentResults` now also collects completed/failed subagent results from the last 60 seconds, closing a race window where results were missed between the yield trigger and collection call
- **Compaction & context engine**: Content-aware compaction guard (require real conversation); session truncation after compaction; persona/language continuity in summaries; stabilized trim ordering with anti-loop detection; preemptive context overflow guard at 85% high-water mark; duplicate tool call ID deduplication
- **Failover hardening**: Cause-chain traversal via recursive `errors.Unwrap()` for accurate error classification; symbolic error code map for Google Cloud, AWS, and Anthropic providers
- **LCM enhancements**: Depth-aware summarization prompts (leaf/session/arc/durable); three-level escalation (normal → aggressive → deterministic fallback); large file interception (>25k tokens) with disk storage; heartbeat pruning; session reconciliation on bootstrap; LLM-bounded `expand_query` action; local timezone formatting; configurable summary model/provider
- **Subagent improvements**: Orphan recovery with resume (max 3 retries, exponential backoff); partial progress synthesis on timeout (max 4000 chars); delivery scope (`All`/`Parent`/`External`) for completion announcements; tool-spawned subagents default to parent-only delivery

### Skills, Memory & Gateway

- **Skills compact fallback**: When skills exceed the token budget, degrades to compact format (name + description + location) via binary search instead of hard truncation
- **Pluggable memory sections**: `MemoryPromptSectionBuilder` interface allows plugins to inject custom sections into the memory prompt layer, with panic protection per builder
- **Channel health monitor**: Background goroutine that detects stale channels and triggers restarts with per-channel cooldown, global hourly cap, and per-restart timeout
- **Session reset with preservation**: `ResetWithPreservation()` clears history/compaction/counters while preserving model, language, thinking level, fast mode, skills, and facts. Exposed via `POST /api/sessions/:id/reset`
- **WS handshake timeout**: Configurable via `DEVCLAW_WS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable (default 10s, max 120s)

### UI

- **ModelCombobox**: New component for model selection with type-ahead support, integrated into ApiConfig and StepProvider pages
- **UnsavedChangesBar**: Notifies users of unsaved config changes with save/discard actions
- **Configuration refactoring**: Streamlined model selection logic, improved collapsible sections, consolidated provider management
- **Channel metadata**: Updated icon property type from `JSX.Element` to `ReactNode` for rendering flexibility

### Plugins

- **Unified YAML-first plugin system**: Replaces both legacy plugin systems (native `.so` and HTTP `PluginManager`) with a manifest-based framework supporting agents, tools, hooks, skills, channels, and services
- **Plugin agent runtime**: `SpawnWithExecutor` for plugin agents with trigger-based routing, bidirectional communication (`delegate_to_plugin_agent` + `escalate_to_main`), and auto-escalation
- **Plugin installer**: CLI commands (`devclaw plugin install/list/remove/update`) and WebUI install/remove flow with path traversal protection
- **Security hardening**: `EvalSymlinks` path validation, `PLUGIN_` prefix for script env vars, secret redaction in frontend config, bounded HTTP responses, context-aware HTTP requests

---

## [1.15.0] — 2026-03-17

### UI

- **Unified design system**: Consolidated two competing design systems into one modern visual language with `rounded-xl/2xl`, `h-11` inputs, modern focus rings. Replaced ~40 ad-hoc buttons with the shared Button component. Removed dead code (Navbar, CollapsibleSection, Dashboard, `cx.ts`)

### Core

- **User-friendly error messages**: Raw LLM errors (429, timeout, quota, auth, context overflow) mapped to friendly messages instead of exposing technical details
- **GLM-5-Turbo support**: New model entry (202K context, 16K default output, agent-optimized)
- **Subagent timeout increase**: Default timeout changed from 5 to 15 minutes to resolve timeout errors on long-running research tasks
- **Skill name normalization**: Auto-normalize skill names (hyphens → underscores, lowercase) in all `SkillDB` public methods
- **Process manager detection**: Runtime prompt layer detects systemd/pm2/docker/k8s

### Media

- **File sending across all channels**: `send_media` tool auto-resolves channel and recipient from delivery context; Web UI delivers media via SSE `media` event with inline rendering (images, audio, video, document download cards)

### Integrations

- **Claude Code OAuth**: Removed API key injection in favor of user's OAuth config; cleared `ANTHROPIC_*` env vars instead of injecting credentials

### Bug Fixes

- Demoted empty streaming fallback log from Warn to Debug
- Added startup warning when no fallback models are configured
- Documented allowed column types in `skill_init` `database_schema`

---

## [1.8.1] - 2025-02-22

### Fixed

- **Provider-specific API keys**: Changed from generic `DEVCLAW_API_KEY` to standard names (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, etc.)
- **Tool schema validation**: Fixed `team_list` tool missing `properties` field causing OpenAI API 400 errors
- **Setup wizard**: Now saves API keys with correct provider-specific names in vault
- **Vault injection**: All secrets are now injected as environment variables with their original names

### Changed

- **LLM client**: `resolveAPIKey()` now looks for provider-specific env vars first, then generic fallback
- **Key resolution priority**: Config key → Provider env var → Generic `API_KEY`
- `DEVCLAW_API_KEY` is now reserved for DevClaw gateway authentication (not LLM providers)

### Security

- Removed hardcoded API keys from example configs
- Vault now injects all secrets as env vars at runtime (no plaintext in config files)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-03-15

### Lossless Compaction Module (LCM) — DAG-Based Memory

Complete port of the lossless-claw compaction system from OpenClaw (TypeScript) to Go, integrated directly into the DevClaw agent. Instead of flat summary strings that discard detail, LCM builds a hierarchical DAG of summaries where every message is persisted verbatim and recoverable on demand.

**Architecture:**
- **DAG structure**: Leaf summaries (depth 0) compress raw messages; condensed summaries (depth 1+) compress groups of summaries, cascading until stable
- **Lossless guarantee**: Every message persisted verbatim in SQLite; summaries link back to source messages via join tables
- **Fresh tail**: Last N messages (default 32) always included raw, never summarized
- **FTS5 graceful degradation**: Full-text search when available, falls back to substring search
- **Feature flag**: `lcm_enabled` (default true) with `LCMConfig` struct for all parameters

**New `lcm` tool** (single dispatcher, 3 actions):
- `lcm grep query="search term"` — search across all messages and summaries (FTS5 + regex + substring)
- `lcm describe summary_id="tree"` — inspect the full DAG structure and metadata
- `lcm expand summary_id="sum_xxx"` — recover original messages behind any summary

**Integration:**
- `buildMessages()` assembles context from DAG (root summaries + fresh tail), falls back to legacy on error
- `managedCompaction()` ingests new messages, evaluates soft/hard triggers, runs leaf + condensed passes
- System prompt automatically includes LCM tool guidance when summaries exist
- Budget-aware assembly: reserves 20% for response, evicts oldest summaries when over budget

**New files:** `lcm.go`, `lcm_store.go`, `lcm_compaction.go`, `lcm_assembler.go`, `lcm_retrieval.go`, `lcm_tools.go`, `lcm_test.go` (22 unit tests)

**Modified files:** `db.go` (7 new tables), `compaction_safeguard.go`, `agent.go`, `assistant.go`

**Configuration:**
```yaml
compaction:
  lcm_enabled: true
  lcm:
    fresh_tail_count: 32
    leaf_chunk_max_tokens: 20000
    condensed_min_children: 4
    condensed_max_children: 8
    soft_trigger_ratio: 0.6
    hard_trigger_ratio: 0.85
    max_summary_tokens: 2000
```

### OpenClaw Feature Alignment (9 Features)

Ported 9 features from OpenClaw to align the Go agent with the TypeScript reference implementation:

- **Configurable compaction timeout**: `CompactionConfig.TimeoutSeconds` (default 900s / 15min)
- **Isolated heartbeat sessions**: `IsolateSession` option gives each heartbeat tick a unique session ID
- **Auto-compaction counter**: Persisted in session metadata for observability
- **Smart strict mode**: Disabled for non-native OpenAI-compat providers (ollama, lmstudio, vllm, huggingface)
- **Fast mode**: Anthropic `service_tier: auto`, OpenAI priority + low reasoning effort
- **Post-compaction memory sync**: Async/await/off modes for memory indexer after compaction
- **Compaction status reactions**: ✍ on start, ⏳ on stall detection (30s), cleaned up on completion
- **`sessions_yield` tool**: Cooperative turn-ending for subagent orchestration (denied for leaf subagents)
- **Skill DB error enrichment**: "table not found" errors now list available tables

### Agent Safeguards & Compaction Hardening

- **Structured compaction**: 5 mandatory sections (Decisions, Open TODOs, Constraints/Rules, Pending user asks, Exact identifiers) with quality guard audit and retry loop
- **Identifier preservation audit**: Post-summarization check that extracted identifiers appear in the summary
- **Ratio-based context pruning**: Soft trim tool results at 30% context usage, hard clear at 50%
- **Emergency compression**: Preserves goal + summary + recent turns instead of discarding all history
- **Anthropic refusal scrubbing**: Removes magic refusal strings from user messages
- **Thinking-level fallback**: Gracefully retries with extended thinking stripped on thinking errors
- **Safety constitution**: `buildSafetyLayer` now populates the safety constitution (was returning empty)
- **Deterministic output**: Sorted map iteration in `buildMinimalFallbackSummary` and `collectFileOperationsSeparated`

### Anti-Hallucination Defense

Three-layer defense against LLM fabricating data when tool calls fail:

- System prompt explicitly forbids inventing tool results
- `[System]` reminder injected into conversation after tool errors
- URL grounding check activated in output guardrail (log-only mode)

### Frontend & i18n

- Complete i18n coverage for Config, Domain, Channels, Access, Groups, Skills pages
- All hardcoded dropdown labels/placeholders replaced with `t()` calls
- Skill toggle/install failure feedback UI
- Dark mode support improvements
- Session management and dashboard error handling improvements
- `web/README.md` updated to match actual codebase (React 19, lucide-react, cn)

### Bug Fixes

- **LCM Hub schema (critical)**: LCM tables were missing from the production `GetSQLiteSchema()` in `backends/sqlite.go`, causing `no such table: lcm_conversations` on every request. Added all 7 LCM tables + indexes + FTS5 best-effort to the Hub migration path
- **LCM legacy migrations**: Added individual CREATE TABLE/INDEX migrations in `copilot/db.go` as belt-and-suspenders for the legacy `OpenDatabase()` path
- **LCM ON DELETE CASCADE**: All 7 LCM foreign keys now cascade deletes through the DAG hierarchy
- **LCM ingestion sequence reset**: Fixed `lcmIngestedSeq` reset from 0 to `len(messages)` — prevented re-ingesting assembled context after compaction
- **LCM aggressive compaction**: Added missing `UpdateLastCompactAt` call when `aggressiveCompaction` bypasses `LCMEngine.Compact()`
- **LCM summarization error**: Fixed `trySummarize` wrapping a nil error when both normal and aggressive summarization return empty responses
- **LCM grep logging**: `grepSubstring` now logs errors instead of silently swallowing them
- Fixed hook tests missing `Enabled: true` (Go bool zero value = false)
- Fixed `TestAllHookEvents` to include message pipeline hooks
- Fixed `TestBuiltinSkills_FormatForPrompt` for on-demand teams skill
- Fixed `MemoryIndexer` data race on `fsWatcher` field access
- Fixed skills backend handler logic for already-installed skills

### Team Tools — Dispatcher Pattern Refactor

Reduced team tool count from 34 to 5 to stay under OpenAI's 128 tool limit:

- **`team_manage`**: Team CRUD operations (create, list, get, update, delete)
- **`team_agent`**: Agent management + working state (create, list, get, update, start, stop, delete, working_get, working_update, working_clear)
- **`team_task`**: Task management (create, list, get, update, assign, delete)
- **`team_memory`**: Shared memory (fact_save, fact_list, fact_delete, doc_create, doc_list, doc_get, doc_update, doc_delete, standup)
- **`team_comm`**: Communication (comment, mention_check, send_message, notify, notify_list)

**Breaking Change**: Individual team tools (e.g., `team_create`, `team_list_agents`) are replaced by dispatcher tools with `action` parameter.

Example:
```
# Old: team_create(name="Engineering", description="Dev team")
# New: team_manage(action="create", name="Engineering", description="Dev team")
```

## [1.5.1] — 2026-02-16

Agent loop safety improvements ported from OpenClaw: tool loop detection, skills token budget guard, heartbeat transcript pruning, compaction retry with backoff, and cron spin loop fix.

### Agent Loop Safety

- **Tool loop detection**: New `ToolLoopDetector` module tracks tool call history with a ring buffer and detects two patterns — **repeat** (same tool+args N times) and **ping-pong** (A→B→A→B). Three severity levels: warning (8x, injects hint), critical (15x, strong nudge), circuit breaker (25x, terminates run). Fully configurable via `config.yaml` under `agent.tool_loop`
- **Per-run detector isolation**: Each agent run creates its own `ToolLoopDetector` instance to avoid cross-session race conditions when multiple users interact concurrently
- **Valid message ordering**: Loop warnings are injected AFTER tool results (assistant→tool→user sequence) to avoid API rejections from providers that validate message order

### Prompt & Memory Optimization

- **Skills prompt bloat guard**: Skills layer now enforces a ~4000 token budget. When total skills text exceeds the budget, largest skills are truncated first (minimum 200 chars preserved). Prevents verbose skill prompts from consuming the entire context window
- **Heartbeat transcript pruning**: No-op heartbeat turns (HEARTBEAT_OK, NO_REPLY, empty) are no longer saved to session history. Only actionable heartbeat responses are persisted, preventing transcript bloat over time

### Reliability

- **Compaction retry with exponential backoff**: The `compactSummarize` LLM call now retries up to 3 times with backoff (2s→4s→8s) on transient errors (rate-limits, timeouts). Properly exits retry loop on context cancellation. Falls back to static summary only after all retries are exhausted
- **Cron spin loop fix**: New `minJobInterval` (2s) guard in scheduler's `executeJob` prevents rapid re-execution when cron fires at the exact same second boundary. Skips silently with debug log when a job ran too recently

### Testing

- **Tool loop detection tests**: 12 test cases covering warning/critical/breaker thresholds, ping-pong detection, reset behavior, disabled mode, ring buffer limits, threshold normalization, and hash determinism
- **Scheduler spin loop tests**: 3 test cases covering spin loop guard, duplicate execution guard, and minJobInterval value assertion
- All tests pass with `-race` detector

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-02-16

Media processing, document enrichment, WhatsApp UX overhaul, comprehensive security hardening, agent intelligence improvements, and full unit test coverage.

### Media & Document Processing

- **Document parsing**: Automatic text extraction from PDF (`pdftotext`), DOCX (`unzip` + XML strip), and 30+ plain text formats (code files, CSV, JSON, YAML, Markdown, etc.)
- **Video enrichment**: First-frame extraction via `ffmpeg` + Vision API description — agent sees `[Video: description]` in context
- **Auto-send generated images**: New `onToolResult` hook on `AgentRun` detects `generate_image` tool output and sends the image file directly to the user's channel as media — no more "image saved to /tmp/..." text responses
- **Async media pipeline**: Document and video enrichment wired into the existing background media processing with placeholder → enriched content flow
- **System prompt documentation**: Agent is informed of media capabilities and how to install system dependencies (`poppler-utils`, `ffmpeg`, `unzip`)

### WhatsApp UX

- **Message duplication fix**: Steer mode now injects OR enqueues (never both) — each message processed exactly once; eliminates duplicate and triple responses to `/stop`
- **Message fragmentation fix**: BlockStreamer params tuned — MinChars 20→200, MaxChars 600→1500, IdleMs 200→1500 — produces coherent paragraphs instead of 4-word fragments
- **Progress flood eliminated**: `ProgressSender` now has per-channel cooldown (60s WhatsApp, 10s WebUI); removed duplicate heartbeats from tool_executor and claude-code skill
- **Queue modes operational**: All 5 modes (collect, steer, followup, interrupt, steer-backlog) fully implemented; removed hardcoded "Recebi sua mensagem..." canned response; default changed from collect→steer

### Agent Intelligence

- **Subagent delegation rewrite**: Complete rewrite of subagent section in system prompt with detailed workflow, concrete examples, and clear rules for when to delegate
- **Parallel task handling**: New "Handling New Messages During Work" prompt section — agent uses `spawn_subagent` for parallel tasks and recognizes follow-ups vs new requests
- **Media awareness**: System prompt now documents all media types the agent can receive and process (images, audio, documents, video)

### Security Hardening

- **Output sanitization**: Strip `[[reply_to_*]]`, `<final>`, `<thinking>`, `NO_REPLY`, `HEARTBEAT_OK` from all outgoing messages via `StripInternalTags` in `FormatForChannel`
- **Empty message guards**: Prevent sending blank messages after tag stripping in `sendReply`, `BlockStreamer`, and `ProgressSender`
- **File permissions hardened**: Session transcripts/facts/meta files 0644→0600 (owner-only); sessions directory 0755→0700
- **Config save safety**: YAML validation before writing + `.bak` backup creation
- **TTS duplicate prevention**: Skip TTS synthesis for `NO_REPLY`/`HEARTBEAT_OK` silent tokens
- **Centralized constants**: `TokenNoReply` and `TokenHeartbeatOK` exported as constants

### LLM Reliability

- **Rate-limit auto-recovery**: Per-model cooldown tracking on 429 responses (duration from `Retry-After` header, min 60s, max 10min)
- **Smart fallback**: Rate-limited models skipped in fallback loop; periodic probe near cooldown expiry (within 10s, throttled at 30s between probes) for automatic recovery without restart
- **Cron reliability**: `LastRunAt` persisted before job execution (not after) to prevent duplicate fires on crash recovery

### Setup & Configuration

- **Vault in setup wizard**: Dedicated vault password field in StepSecurity with toggle for separate vault vs WebUI password
- **Owner phone in setup**: Setup wizard collects owner phone number, formats as WhatsApp JID — owner gets full tool access (bash, exec, write_file, etc.)
- **Skill installation from WebUI**: New endpoints `GET /api/skills/available`, `POST /api/skills/install`, `POST /api/skills/{name}/toggle`; modal with search and categories in the Skills page

### Testing

- **259 test cases across 13 files** covering 3 phases:
  - *Pure logic*: markdown formatting, message splitting, queue modes, config loading, memory hardening, session keys
  - *Security*: SSRF protection, input/output guardrails, rate limiting, vault encryption, keyring injection
  - *Stateful components*: tool guard permissions, access control, skill registry
- **Makefile integration**: `make test` and `make test-v` targets with `-race` detector and `sqlite_fts5` tag
- All tests run with `t.Parallel()` where safe, table-driven patterns, `t.TempDir()` for isolation

### Dependencies

- System: `poppler-utils` (PDF), `ffmpeg` (video), `unzip` (DOCX) — optional, graceful fallback when missing

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-02-16

Performance improvements, new concurrency architecture, advanced agent capabilities, comprehensive security hardening, and new tools.

### Performance

- **Adaptive debounce**: reduced default from 1000ms to 200ms; followup debounce at 500ms; idle sessions drain immediately
- **Unified send+stream endpoint**: new `POST /api/chat/{sessionId}/stream` combines send and stream in a single HTTP request, eliminating a round-trip
- **Asynchronous media enrichment**: vision/transcription runs in background while the agent starts responding; results are injected via interrupt channel
- **Background compaction**: `maybeCompactSession` now runs in a goroutine, no longer blocking the response path
- **Faster block streaming**: `MinChars` reduced from 50→20, `IdleMs` from 400→200ms; eliminated double idle check for immediate flushing
- **Lazy prompt composition**: memory and skills layers cached (60s TTL) with background refresh; critical layers (bootstrap, history) still loaded synchronously

### Architecture

- **Lane-based concurrency** (`lanes.go`): configurable lanes (session, cron, subagent) with per-lane queue and concurrency limits — prevents work-type contention
- **Event bus** (`events.go`): in-memory pub/sub for agent lifecycle events (delta, tool_use, done, error) — supports multi-consumer streams
- **WebSocket JSON-RPC** (`gateway/websocket.go`): bidirectional real-time communication as alternative to HTTP/SSE; supports client requests (chat.abort) and server events
- **Fast abort** (`tool_executor.go`): abort channel with `ResetAbort`/`Abort`/`IsAborted` — tools detect and respond to external abort signals during execution

### Agent Capabilities

- **Queue modes** (`queue_modes.go`): configurable strategies for incoming messages when session is busy — collect, steer, followup, interrupt, steer-backlog
- **Model failover** (`model_failover.go`): automatic LLM failover with reason classification (billing, rate limit, auth, timeout, format) and per-model cooldowns
- **Proactive prompts** (`prompt_layers.go`): reply tags, silent reply tokens, heartbeat guidance, reasoning format, memory recall, subagent orchestration, and messaging directives
- **Agent steering**: interrupt during tool execution; tools check `interruptCh` for incoming messages to steer behavior mid-run
- **Context pruning** (`agent.go`): proactive soft/hard trim of old tool results based on turn age — prevents context bloat without waiting for LLM overflow
- **Memory flush pre-compaction**: explicit "pre-compaction memory flush turn" saves durable memories to disk before compaction using append-only strategy
- **Expanded directives**: new `/verbose`, `/reasoning` (alias for `/think`), `/queue`, `/usage`, `/activation` commands with thread-safe config access

### Security

- **Workspace containment** (`workspace_containment.go`): sandbox path validation and symlink escape protection for all file operations
- **Memory injection hardening** (`memory_hardening.go`): treats memories as untrusted data; escapes HTML entities, strips dangerous tags, wraps in `<relevant-memories>` tags, detects injection patterns
- **Request body limiter**: 2MB limit on `POST /v1/chat/completions` to prevent OOM from oversized payloads
- **Partial output on abort**: `handleChatAbort` now includes a `partial` flag indicating preserved partial output before cancellation

### New Tools & Features

- **Browser automation** (`browser_tool.go`): Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) integration with `browser_navigate`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_content`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`
- **Interactive canvas** (`canvas_host.go`): HTML/JS canvas with live-reload via temporary HTTP server; `canvas_create`, `canvas_update`, `canvas_list`, `canvas_stop`
- **Session management tools**: `sessions_list` (all workspaces), `sessions_send` (inter-agent messaging), `sessions_delete`, `sessions_export` (full history + metadata as JSON)
- **Lifecycle hooks** (`hooks.go`): 16+ event types (SessionStart, PreToolUse, AgentStop, etc.) with priority-ordered dispatch, sync blocking, async non-blocking, and panic recovery
- **Group chat** (`group_chat.go`): activation modes, intro messages, context injection, participant tracking, quiet hours, ignore patterns
- **Tailscale integration** (`tailscale.go`): Tailscale Serve/Funnel for secure remote access without manual port forwarding or DNS configuration
- **Advanced cron** (`scheduler.go`): isolated sessions per job, announce handler for broadcasting results, subagent spawn option, per-job timeouts, job labels

### Session Management

- **Structured session keys**: `SessionKey` struct (Channel, ChatID, Branch) enables multi-agent routing
- **Session CRUD**: `DeleteByID`, `Export`, `RenameSession` on SessionStore
- **Bounded followup queue**: FIFO eviction at 20 items maximum

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed data race in `ListSessions` when reading `lastActiveAt`/`CreatedAt` without lock
- Fixed `splitMax` panic on empty separator
- Fixed restored sessions not persisting (missing `persistence` field)
- Fixed duplicate hook event registration in `HookManager.Register`
- Fixed panic in hook dispatch — individual handler panics no longer crash dispatch goroutine
- Fixed race condition in canvas `Update` — hold mutex during channel send to prevent panic from concurrent `Stop`
- Fixed infinite loop in `findFreePort` when `MaxCanvases` exceeds available port range
- Fixed `tailscale.go` hostname parsing — replaced manual JSON parsing with `json.Unmarshal`
- Fixed data race on `Job.LastRunAt`/`RunCount`/`LastError` in scheduler `executeJob`
- Fixed scheduler persisting removed jobs — added existence check before `Save`
- Fixed `commands.go` reading config without mutex — added `configMu.RLock()` to `/queue` and `/activation`

### Frontend (WebUI)

- New `createPOSTSSEConnection` for POST-based SSE in unified send+stream flow
- Updated `useChat` hook to eliminate separate `api.chat.send` + `createSSEConnection` calls
- Added `run_start` event handler for unified stream protocol

### Dependencies

- Added `github.com/gorilla/websocket` (WebSocket support)
- Added `github.com/robfig/cron/v3` (advanced cron scheduling)

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-02-12

### Performance

- Increased default agent turn timeout from 90s to 300s to handle slow model cold starts (e.g. GLM-5 ~30-60s first turn)
- Added transient error retry (1x, 2.5s delay) for streaming LLM calls before falling back to non-streaming
- Bootstrap file loading now uses in-memory SHA-256 cache to avoid redundant disk reads

### Progressive Message Delivery (Block Streaming)

- New `BlockStreamer` module: accumulates LLM output tokens and sends them progressively to channels (WhatsApp) as partial messages
- Configurable: `block_stream.enabled`, `block_stream.min_chars` (default: 80), `block_stream.idle_ms` (default: 1200), `block_stream.max_chars` (default: 3000)
- Natural break detection: splits at paragraph boundaries, sentence endings, or list items
- Avoids duplicate final messages when blocks have already been sent

### Advanced Memory System

- **SQLite-backed memory store** with FTS5 (BM25 ranking) and in-process vector search (cosine similarity)
- **Embedding provider**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims) with SQLite-backed embedding cache to reduce API calls
- **Markdown chunker**: intelligent splitting by headings, paragraphs, and sentences with configurable overlap and max tokens
- **Delta sync**: hash-based change detection — only re-embeds chunks that actually changed
- **Hybrid search** (RRF): combines vector similarity and BM25 keyword scores with configurable weights (default: 0.7 vector / 0.3 BM25)
- **Session memory hook**: on `/new` command, summarizes the conversation via LLM and saves to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- New `memory_index` tool for manual re-indexing of memory files
- `memory_search` upgraded to use hybrid search when SQLite store is available (falls back to substring search)
- Configurable via `memory.embedding`, `memory.search`, `memory.index`, `memory.session_memory` in config.yaml

### Bootstrap Improvements

- `BOOT.md` support: agent executes instructions from `BOOT.md` after startup (proactive initialization)
- `BootstrapMaxChars` limit prevents oversized bootstrap from consuming the token budget
- Subagent-specific filtering: subagents only load `AGENTS.md` and `TOOLS.md` (not the full bootstrap set)

### Session Persistence

- `SessionPersistence` properly wired to session store — conversations now survive restarts
- JSONL history, facts, and metadata are loaded on startup and saved on changes

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed race condition in `/new` command where session history could be cleared before the summary goroutine reads it (now captures a snapshot first)
- Fixed hybrid search merge key collision: different chunks from the same file that share a prefix are no longer collapsed
- Fixed FTS5 query injection: user input is now sanitized and wrapped in double quotes for phrase matching
- Fixed potential SQL row leak in `IndexChunks` error path

### New Config Options

```yaml
block_stream:
  enabled: false
  min_chars: 80
  idle_ms: 1200
